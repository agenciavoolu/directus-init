## Install

Steps:
- [Download a zip](https://github.com/ched-dev/directus-init/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of this repo, extract it, and rename the folder to your project name and change into the new folder
- Create a `.env` with contents from `.env.sample` and [update config options](https://docs.directus.io/self-hosted/config-options.html) as desired
- Create your PostgreSQL DB wherever you plan to host or locally in CLI run `createdb directus`, then add connection options to `.env`
- (Optional) Run the `tasks/pg_install_postgis.sql` in your database if you want to support location data
- Run `npm run build` (installs packages & builds extensions)
- Run `npx directus bootstrap` (creates local folders and runs initial db one-time setup)
- Create an `uploads` directory if you are storing locally, alternatively set the S3 config options in `.env`
- Run `npm start` (use this each time to boot up server)

## Directus Studio Setup

After you've installed everything and are running the Directus Studio, you should update a few things.

**In Settings > Project Settings**  
- Update Project Name as this will be used for email sender name
- Update branding and style (color) to make this instance yours
- Turn on the API Viewer Module in the sidebar (Modules > API Viewer check)
- Set a requirement for strong passwords (Security > Auth Password Policy) & login attempts

**In Settings > Roles & Permissions**  
- Create a role for non-admin users (if needed)
- Require 2FA on any roles you think should have it

## Extensions

We've created a bundle which can hold all of your custom extensions. This approach allows you to add it's own dependencies in one place, as well as integrate into the build process easily.

See the `extensions/directus-extension-app-bundle/README.md` file to learn more about adding extensions.

If you are developing extensions, open a second terminal to watch and rebuild with `npm run extensions`.
